# doNothingTC

## Test Case Description

`doNothingTC` is based on the DoNothing benchmark in
[BlockBench](https://github.com/ooibc88/blockbench).

For your reference, the original description of DoNothing benchmark in the SIGMOD
paper is like the below:
> This contract accepts transaction as input and simply returns. In other
> words, it involves minimal number of operations at the execution layer and
> data model layer, thus the overall performance will be mainly determined by
> the consensus layer. Previous works on performance of blockchain consensus
> protocol use time to consensus to measure its performance. In BLOCKBENCH,
> this metric is directly reflected in the transaction latency.

`doNothingTC` implements a Go test function that calls the `nothing` function,
whose body is empty (i.e., does nothing), in the `Nothing` contract implemented
in `DoNothing.sol`.

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Run` | Call the `nothing` function, which does nothing, in the `DoNothing` contract |

This directory has the following source files.

- `DoNothing.sol`: `DoNothing` contract file written in solidity
   - Origin: https://github.com/ooibc88/blockbench/blob/master/benchmark/contracts/ethereum/donothing.sol
   - Updated the solidity version in the pragma statement to v0.4.24
   - Modified function signatures to suppress solc warnings
- `DoNothing.go`: Go binding code generated by `abigen` using `go generate`
- `doNothingTC.go`: initialization and test function implementation
   - Implemented test logic included in
     [https://github.com/ooibc88/blockbench/tree/master/src/macro/kvstore](https://github.com/ooibc88/blockbench/tree/master/src/macro/kvstore).
     Note that BlockBench implemented test routines in the driver of the YCSB
     benchmark.
